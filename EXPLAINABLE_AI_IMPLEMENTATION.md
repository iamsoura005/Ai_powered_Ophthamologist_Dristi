## 🌟 Key Features

### 🔍 Visual Explanations
- **Heatmaps**: Show AI attention areas in red/yellow (high) to blue (low)
- **Overlay Mode**: Original image with attention heatmap superimposed
- **Attention Center**: Red marker showing primary focus point
- **Quadrant Analysis**: Distribution of attention across image regions

### 📊 Attention Analytics
- **Coverage Percentage**: How much of the image received attention
- **Concentration Score**: How focused vs. distributed the attention is
- **Dominant Quadrant**: Primary area of AI focus
- **Max Attention Value**: Peak attention intensity

### 🏥 Medical Interpretations
- **Focus Description**: Where the AI looked (anatomical regions)
- **Clinical Relevance**: Why that focus area matters for the diagnosis
- **Confidence Analysis**: Explanation of prediction confidence levels
- **Recommendations**: Clinical guidance based on attention patterns

### 🎛️ Interactive Features
- **Multi-class Comparison**: Compare explanations across different diagnoses
- **Zoom Controls**: Detailed examination of attention areas
- **Download Options**: Save heatmaps and overlays as PNG files
- **Responsive Design**: Works across desktop and mobile devices

## 🧪 Technical Implementation

### Grad-CAM Algorithm
```python
# Generate gradients for target class
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    conv_outputs, predictions = grad_model(img_array)
    loss = predictions[:, class_idx]

# Calculate attention weights
grads = tape.gradient(loss, conv_outputs)
pooled_grads = tf.reduce_mean(grads, axis=(0, 1, 2))

# Generate heatmap
heatmap = tf.reduce_sum(tf.multiply(pooled_grads, conv_outputs), axis=-1)
```

### Medical Interpretation Logic
- **Anatomical Mapping**: Focus areas mapped to retinal anatomy
- **Disease-Specific Analysis**: Tailored interpretations per condition
- **Confidence Correlation**: Attention patterns linked to prediction confidence
